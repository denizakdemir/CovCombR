Description: Combine partial covariance matrices using a Wishart-EM algorithm. 
    Methods are described in the November 2019 article by Akdemir et al. 
    <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/857425v1>.
    It can be used to combine partially overlapping covariance matrices 
    from independent trials, partially overlapping multi-view relationship
    data from genomic experiments, partially overlapping Gaussian graphs
    described by their covariance structures. 
    High dimensional covariance estimation, 
    multi-view data integration.
    high dimensional covariance graph estimation.
